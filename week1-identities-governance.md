# Week 1 â€“ Identities & Governance (The Club Entrance ðŸ•º)

## What I Did
- Created an Azure AD tenant, users, and groups  
- Practiced RBAC: tested Reader vs. Contributor permissions  
- Created a resource group and added policies to block VMs without tags  
- Configured Conditional Access to block logins outside Australia  

## How I Did It
1. Azure AD tenant created via [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)  
2. Added users & groups under Azure Active Directory â†’ Users/Groups  
3. Assigned Reader & Contributor roles and tested resource creation  
4. Policy created to enforce tagging on VMs  
5. Configured Conditional Access â†’ Location filter â†’ Block non-AU

## Why It Matters
- Shows control of **identity and access**  
- Demonstrates ability to enforce **governance policies**  
- Real-world security practice â†’ exactly what Azure admins do daily
